# RMS - Result Management System

This is a project for managing academic results in a university setting. It's built with Django and includes a web interface for different types of users to manage student grades and academic records. The project also includes a REST API for external integration.

## What This Project Does

This system helps manage student results in a university. Different people have different roles:

- **Students** can view their results
- **Lecturers** can enter grades for their courses
- **HODs** (Head of Department) can approve results for their department
- **Faculty Deans** can manage their entire faculty
- **Exam Officers** handle result processing
- **DAAA** and **Senate** do final approvals
- **Super Admin** manages the whole system

The basic flow is: Lecturer enters grades â†’ Exam Officer checks â†’ HOD approves â†’ Faculty Dean approves â†’ DAAA â†’ Senate â†’ Results published.

## Technical Details

- **Framework:** Django 5.2.4 with Django REST Framework
- **Database:** SQLite (for development)
- **Frontend:** HTML templates with Bootstrap
- **Authentication:** Django's built-in auth system

## ðŸš€ Quick Start 

You'll need Python installed on your computer.

### ðŸš€ Quick Setup
This repository includes a complete database with sample data, so you can run it immediately:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ahmadlabaran/rms.git
cd rms

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate
# Or on Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations (already applied, but just in case)
python manage.py migrate

# Run the server immediately
python manage.py runserver
```

Then go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

### ðŸŽ¯ Ready-to-Use Features
- **Complete database** with all tables and sample data
- **All migrations applied** - no setup needed
- **Multiple user roles** with different dashboards
- **REST API** ready for integration
- **Web interface** for all user types

### ðŸ”‘ Test Accounts
The database includes test accounts for all roles:
- Super Admin, Faculty Deans, HODs, Lecturers, Students, etc.
- Check the admin panel or create new accounts as needed

## API Usage

The project includes some REST API endpoints that can be used by other applications:

### Basic Authentication
```http
POST /api/external/authenticate/
{
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
}
```

### Getting Data
```http
GET /api/students/
Authorization: Token your_token_here
```

This is useful if you want to integrate with other systems or build a mobile app.
