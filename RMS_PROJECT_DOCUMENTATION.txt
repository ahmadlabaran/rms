================================================================================
                    RESULT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RMS) PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
================
This is a comprehensive Result Management System for a school that handles academic 
results with a multi-level approval workflow. The system integrates with an existing 
website's authentication system using Django REST Framework APIs.

USER ROLES & HIERARCHY:
======================
1. STUDENT - View own results, download PDFs by semester/level
2. LECTURER - Enter CA/Exam scores, submit results course by course
3. ADMISSION OFFICER - Create student records (matric, email, faculty, dept, level)
4. EXAM OFFICER - Review/modify results, manage carry-over lists, approve/reject
5. HOD (Head of Department) - Create courses, approve departmental results
6. FACULTY DEAN - Set grading scales, assign lecturers, enter past records
7. DAAA (Director Academic Affairs) - Publish results, manage sessions, final approval
8. SENATE - Final oversight and publication approval
9. SUPER ADMIN - System administration, role management, alternative logins

APPROVAL WORKFLOW CHAIN:
=======================
Lecturer → Exam Officer → HOD → Faculty Dean → DAAA → Senate → Publication

KEY BUSINESS RULES:
==================
- Each faculty has its own grading system (set by Faculty Dean)
- Auto-calculation: CA + Exam = Total Score → Auto Grade Assignment
- Carry-over criteria set by Faculty Dean, auto-flagged by system
- One active academic session at a time (DAAA controls)
- Sessions with results cannot be deleted
- Course-by-course result submission
- Results locked once submitted (unless rejected back)
- Private rejection notes between rejector and recipient only
- Empty tables by default - search/filter required to show data
- Automatic student unenrollment at session end (results preserved)
- Courses can belong to multiple departments (e.g., GST courses)

PERMISSION SYSTEM:
=================
- Users can have multiple roles simultaneously
- Super Admin can create alternative login credentials for any role
- Alternative logins work alongside existing website authentication
- Manual revoke only (no automatic expiration)
- Role-based data filtering (users see only their scope)

NOTIFICATION SYSTEM:
===================
- In-app notifications disappear when clicked/viewed
- Email notifications for result publication
- DAAA chooses notification method: immediate, by faculty, department, level, or custom
- Students get notified when results are published

EXPORT CAPABILITIES:
===================
- All exports in Excel format
- Students: PDF downloads for selected semesters/levels (no transcripts)
- Transcripts only for: DAAA, Senate, Faculty Deans
- Exam Officer: Carry-over lists (filterable by session)

WHAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED:
=======================
Complete database model design (8 model groups):
   1. Core Academic Structure (Sessions, Faculties, Departments, Levels)
   2. Courses & Students (Course creation, assignments, student records)
   3. Grading System (Faculty-specific scales, carry-over criteria)
   4. Results & Enrollment (Auto-calculation, status tracking)
   5. Approval Workflow (Complete audit trail)
   6. User Roles (Multiple roles, alternative logins)
   7. Notifications (In-app + publication control)
   8. System Configuration (Settings, audit logging)

✅ Database models implemented and migrated
✅ Universal REST API implementation:
   - Token-based authentication
   - Role-based permissions
   - CRUD operations for all models
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Rate limiting and security
   - CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

✅ Universal External Integration System:
   - Works with ANY technology stack (PHP, Node.js, Python, Java, .NET, etc.)
   - Standard REST API endpoints
   - Comprehensive authentication system
   - API documentation endpoint
   - Integration examples for multiple languages

✅ Production-ready features:
   - Rate limiting (100/hour anonymous, 1000/hour authenticated)
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Audit logging for all actions
   - Security best practices
   - Browsable API interface for testing

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW:
==========================

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
====================
1. COMPLETE API ENDPOINTS DESIGN
   - Results Management APIs (core workflow)
   - Grading System APIs
   - Notification APIs
   - Reporting & Export APIs

2. DJANGO PROJECT SETUP
   - Configure Django REST Framework in settings.py
   - Set up authentication (JWT tokens for API)
   - Configure CORS for existing website integration
   - Database configuration
   - Email configuration (for notifications)

3. IMPLEMENT CORE MODELS
   - Create and run migrations
   - Set up model relationships
   - Implement auto-calculation logic in Result model
   - Create model admin interfaces

4. AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
   - Implement dual authentication (existing website + alternative logins)
   - Role-based permission classes
   - JWT token management
   - User role middleware

5. API IMPLEMENTATION (Priority Order)
   - Authentication endpoints
   - User role management
   - Academic structure management
   - Student management
   - Course management and enrollment
   - Results entry and approval workflow
   - Notification system
   - Reporting and exports

6. BUSINESS LOGIC IMPLEMENTATION
   - Auto-grade calculation based on faculty grading scales
   - Carry-over detection and flagging
   - Session management (one active, locking)
   - Approval workflow state management
   - Notification triggers

7. FRONTEND INTEGRATION
   - API documentation for existing website integration
   - Response format standardization
   - Error handling and validation
   - Search and filtering implementations

8. REPORTING SYSTEM
   - PDF generation for student results
   - Excel export functionality
   - Transcript generation
   - Carry-over list exports

9. TESTING & VALIDATION
   - Unit tests for models and business logic
   - API endpoint testing
   - Integration testing with existing website
   - Role-based access testing

10. DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION
    - Production settings configuration
    - Database optimization
    - Security hardening
    - Performance optimization

TECHNICAL STACK:
===============
- Backend: Django + Django REST Framework
- Database: (To be configured - PostgreSQL recommended)
- Authentication: JWT tokens + Django sessions
- File Generation: ReportLab (PDF), openpyxl (Excel)
- Email: Django email backend
- API Documentation: Django REST Framework browsable API

INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
========================
- Must integrate with existing website authentication
- API responses in JSON format for existing website consumption
- Role-based access control
- Real-time notification system
- Secure file download system

CURRENT STATUS:
==============
Project is in DESIGN PHASE - Database models completed, ready to begin API 
implementation and Django project configuration.

Next immediate action: Complete API endpoints design and configure Django settings.
